    This could be pedagogically valuable because it would simplify code in
    `UnoGame` and because it would reinforce the idea that the same UnoGame could be
    used as the backend of a GUI or web-based implementation.
    Students could switch into a different mode while reading this file: here, it's about
    re-skinning the game (e.g. making it snarky), whereas over in game.py it's about the
    algorithms and interactions.
    It's also another straightforward example of objects interacting.

    Most important point: The View has no idea what is going on.
